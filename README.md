<h2>Description</h2>
This project is an embedded firmware solution for an electric stove and oven powered by grid and battery sources. Developed in C++ for the ESP32, the system safely manages power distribution while providing real-time user control and feedback. 
<br />

<h2>Features</h2>

- <b>ðŸ”§ Dual Burner Control</b> 
  - Adjustable via potentiometers
  - Software Pulse Width Modulation with relay control
  - Hysteresis filtering to prevent flicker and noise
- <b>ðŸ”¥ Oven Control (Bake/Broil Modes)</b>
  - Potentiometer-based temperature setpoint
  - ADC-based thermal feedback (Â°F)
  - Automatic hysteresis-based bake relay cycling
  - Broil mode engages both bake and broil elements
- <b>âš¡ Intelligent Power Management</b>
  - Supports grid (1500W max) and battery (3000W max) sources
  - Dynamically limits total system load based on real-time power usage
  - Enforces constraints to prevent overload (e.g. disables burners when oven is active under high load)
- <b>ðŸ“Ÿ OLED User Interface</b>
  - Real-time status display for:
    - Burner power (%)
    - Oven mode and temperature
    - Setpoint temperature
    - Battery level


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>C++</b> 
- <b>Arduino</b>
- <b>Visual Studio Code</b>
- <b>PlatformIO</b>
